make DIR=files ARG1=abc ARG2=def ARG3=fyz

Program runs fine, did not know whether you wanted to set the directory or have it as an argument or just search for sub directory. I have a directory being passed as a command line argument and then searching the contents for a txt file. Other than should work fine. Included a makefile you can run the command above DIR is the directory then the rest are the arguments you are passing in.
